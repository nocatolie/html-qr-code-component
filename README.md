## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I started coding without using flexbox and saw that the page was not responsive not to mention that the footer overlapped the qr code.

So I started researching a way to make my website more responsive and that led me to experiment with flexbox.

Flexbox main idea is to give the container the ability to alter its itemâ€™s sizes to best fill the available space, to prevent overflow and this is what I needed.

Here are some examples where I use flexbox:


```css
.container{
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
}
```
```css
.envoltorio{
    flex: 1;
    display: flex;
    align-content: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```



### Continued development

I'm still not completely comfortable using flexbox but is a technique I found very useful and that I want to refine and perfect.

This will help me in many future proyects.
